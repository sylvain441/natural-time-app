Natural Time is a system that reinvents how time is measured. Through a 360-degree clock and a 13-moon spiral calendar, the sun serves as the universal reference for the flow of time.

## About

### The Natural Clock
A clock inspired by nature, with a single hand rotating once per day, following the sun's path across the sky along a 360-degree dial.

### The 13 Moons Calendar
An alternative to the Gregorian calendar, drawing from worldwide traditions:
- 13 moons (months) of 28 days each
- One rainbow day
- 13 moons Ã— 28 days + 1 = 365

Together, the Natural Clock and the 13 Moons Spiral can replace or complement the 24-hour clock and Gregorian calendar.
