[NATURAL CLOCK]

Time is a convention.  
Thanks to it, we keep track of movement in the material world.
It's influence on our daily life operates as an invisible core background program.

- When do we wake up ? And when do we go to bed ?
- When do we eat ? Why all together at the same time ?
- When do we sit, walk, exercice ?
- How long do we work, rest and take "holidays" ?
- When do we enjoy a moment altogether ?
- When and what do we celebrate ?
- ...

Tic Tac, Tic Tac  
Always running, never stopping...

Tic Tax, Tic Tax  
Earn, spend and pay taxes 🥵

Did you know the latin root of the word "Calendar" means "account book" ? Time has got a forced marriage with "money" and "taxes" concepts.

## ARTIFICIAL TIME

Nowadays most of the humanity "adopted" a very strange way to measure time. There is so much oddness encoded in our artificial clock coupled with the gregorian calendar.

- Why do the hand spins around the clock two times a day ?
- Why sept-ember is not the 7th month ? oct-ober the 8th ?
- Why 24 hours, 60 minutes of 60 seconds ? 
- What happened between the 4th and the 15th of october 1582 ? [wiki]
- Why does the line of date change looks so weird ? [wiki]
- Why can't we calculate the time anywhere on the planet without knowing about administrative timezones and contextual daylight saving periods ?
- 29th of february happens every year which is multiple of 4, right ? Not so simple : for example neither 1900 nor 2100|2200|2300 are bissexitiles, but 2000 and 2400 are 🤯 ! [wiki]
- 31|30|29|28 days in a month 🤔 ? 
- What about the year 0 ? [wiki]
- ...

Back in the time, Emperor Julius thought a month should carry its unquestionnably glorious name. So was July. Later on Augustus wanted the same privilege, that's when Sextilis became August.  
Our main tool to measure time on Earth embeds large bits of the gigantic egos of emperors and popes from the past.

Time changed so many times throught history...  
Yet we believe it has always been like this.  
No at all... Time is just a convention, and we use a very bizarre one.

Just for the good laugh, if we had to invent a tool designed to measure distances the same way we measure time, it would look like this :

## NATURAL TIME

> Time, past, future are nothing but illusions.  
> Very persistent illusions.

Alone in the wild, there would be no need to use a time convention like our 24 hours of 3600 seconds. A calendar would be useless because Nature herself is the time tracker : 
- Flowers, leaves falling, snow, winds and birds gives permanent clues about our position in the year
- During the day, the sun is the clock
- And the dance of stars with the moon takes over during the night

Time convention happen when we start to interact with other fellows.
- _"Let's have a tea at ...."_
- _"Rendez-vous on the  ... of ... for the project"_
- _"It will take me ... days to cross the mountain"_
- _"Give me ... minutes"_

Isn't today a perfect moment to introduce a new time convention based on logic, common sense and the natural cycles? A new time tracking standard that feels so natural that we ask ourselves : _"why don't we started measuring time this way long time ago?"_.

Natural Time is obvious, simple, elegant and independant from any political interference or religious beliefs. Asking for the times is the same as asking for the sun position in the sky.

## HOW DOES IT WORKS ?

### How do you read the clock ?

The time hand follow the course of the Sun starting from 0° at the middle of the night (aka "nadir") to 360° the next midnight. 180° Sun corresponds to the middle of the day.

- _"Let's meet precisely at 144.41° sun"_
- _"Workshop duration is around 60° sun"_
- _"Gates open 10°° before the sunset"_

### Why 360 degrees ? What about hours, minutes, seconds ?

The full day is represented by a circle.  
An arbitrary yet well established convention is to divide a circle into 360°. The learning curve is almost equals to none by using this convention. Another advantage of choosing 360° is the compliance with the longitude/latitude system.

Even though 360 degrees with decimals using base 10 feels like the most universal at the moment, nyone can choose to divide the circle the way it suits his/her needs..

| Natural degrees | Artificial hours | Artificial minutes | Artificial seconds |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **°360°** | 24h | - | - |
| **°60°** | 4h | - | - |
| **°30°** | 2h | - | - |
| **°10°** | - | 40 min | - |
| **°5°** | - | 20 min | - |
| **°1°** | - | 4 min | - |
| **°0,1°** | - | - | 24s |
| **°0,01°** | - | - | 2,4s |

### What is the deal with longitude?

Natural time is a local time. The "midday" (i.e 180° Sun) is really the middle of the day at your specific location. Artificial time uses artificial timezones following artificial zigzaging economic borders. 

Natural time relates on the longitude system to display the time correctly. Imagin that you travel 1° longitude to the west, you will have to move the time hand 1° backward to get the local time of your destination.

If you are lost in the middle of nowhere, you can always calibrate your clock with this method : when the sun reaches its highest point in the sky (or crosses the south/north line) set it up at 180°.

Natural time is always related with geographical data, at least the longitude.
